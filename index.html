  <h2>designer, photographer, husband, father</h2>

  <p>Hi there, I'm Dan. I'm a product designer and front-end developer working at <a href="https://automattic.com">Automattic</a>, the company behind WordPress.com, Akismet, Jetpack, and many other products. I love creating meaningful, usable interfaces.</p>
  <p>Before joining Automattic I worked for various small companies and co-founded <a href="https://cucumbertown.com">Cucumbertown</a> and <a href="https://brewtrackr.com">BrewTrackr</a>. In my spare time I'm a photographer, musician, father, husband, <a href="https://brewtrackr.com/danhauk">beer drinker</a>, and homebrewer.
